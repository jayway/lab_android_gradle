# Gradle Lab for Android

This lab is meant to get you up and running with building your Android apps with Gradle.

## Preparations

First of all, you need to check out this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/jayway/lab_android_gradle
```

You also need to have gradle installed. If you're on a mac and have brew install, `brew install gradle` will do the trick. Linux users can most likely `apt-get` it. For other platforms, check out http://www.gradle.org/.
